# Agents_Performance

Scenario:
There is a customer concerned with the performance of the customer service agents that a company offers. 
The agents' (experts) job is to interact with buyers that have questions when purchasing from the customer's website and help finalize the sale. 
The dataset provided contains information about the performance of both companies' agents. 
My job as a data analyst is to go through the data to understand where the customer's performance concerns come from, 
  provide insights as to how do the agents' performance can be improved, 
  and provide advice as to what parts of the business might suffer if too much emphasis is put into sales.

Analysis was done using MySQL and visualizations using Tableau.

Conclusions:

•	The service provider agents' (experts) number of contacts was lower than that of the company's agents.

•	Low contacts arise from many agents having zero contacts.

•	Agents with zero contacts were screened out. This revealed that the service provider's agents engaging with the customers were being more productive than the companies own agents (also apparent when agents with at least ten contacts per hour were considered). 

•	Overall performance could be improved if the agents with zero contacts performance were to be improved.

•	Customer satisfaction was positively correlated with contact handling time, so this is an area that could be affected if the handling time were to be reduced to increase the number of contacts per hour in favor of revenue.
